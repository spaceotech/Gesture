If you open any app in your smartphone, you’ll see it has a swipe, pinch or tap gesture implemented. Now these gestures are actually secret to make great mobile apps. They can help pave the way to interactional interfaces and also increases speed in user action. All in all, it provides comfortable way to interact with devices.

And after knowing all this, I thought to create a demo on it and written a tutorial to [Make Your App More Interactional By Implementing iOS Gesture Recognizer](https://www.spaceotechnologies.com/make-ios-app-interactional-ios-gesture-recognizer/).
